        <h3>One Time Membership Fee</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>When becoming a member you are responsible for paying for your first month of service as well as a One-Time
            Membership Fee that covers the administration and support of your account. Therefore, you are the owner of
            the membership but you donâ€™t own the device or the carrier account your line is on.</p>
        <p>You may of course cancel your subscription with us at anytime by simply returning your device and we never
            charge any cancellation fees! Easy, Simple, Clean!</p>
