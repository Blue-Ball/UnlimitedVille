                        <expand-collapse>
                            Unlimited phone plans are ONLY unlimited for PHONE data use. Unlimited phone plans only allow 5-10gb of tethering. (the ability to use the phones data with your computer, tablet, or other connected devices.) That is the equivalent of streaming a couple HD Netflix movies. Unlike an unlimited phone plan, our plans and devices can entirely replace your slow home or office internet solution for an unlimited, unthrottled, high-speed wireless data connection.

                            The two main devices we offer are hotspots and routers. Routers are best for most home/office setups, as they provide far superior range and connectivity. Hotspots provide a battery powered solution to take your WIFI on the go. All of our devices ship pre-configured and plug-and-play, which means setup is simply connecting the power cable to the wall…so you can spend less time setting-up and more time surfing the web! Goodbye invasive installs. Hello Unlimitedville.

                            If the plan you initially choose does not connect or is slower than expected, this most likely means a lack of LTE coverage/reception at your location, or less commonly, the cellular tower your device is connecting to is either using outdated antennas or is congested from high usage in your area. Regardless of the reason, our 14-Day No Risk Return Policy has you completely covered. Simply return your device for a 100% Refund and let us help you choose another plan that’s best for you!

                            Essentially NO. Here is the deal... if you live in downtown L.A. and try to surf during rush hour, you may not receive the highest speeds because the cell towers get clogged. Unless something similar like this happens to you, then all should be well. Put it this way, we haven&#039;t had any complaints ;) Legally we have to let you know that where you will be utilizing our hotspots, the major carriers may be working on the cell towers close to you that could slow you down. That usually doesn&#039;t happen... but occasionally it does. We have no control over possible network optimizations being conducted by major carriers if any of their cell towers are being updated or de-prioritized.

                            The speeds of all of our hotspots (LTE speeds) depend entirely on how close you are to cell towers in your area, and which carrier you choose. We&#039;ve had reports of over 80 MBPS from those who are close to a cell tower with LTE+ (Advanced)...  all the way down to 1 MBPS that are several miles away from a tower. So you’ll want to pick the carrier plan that has the best and strongest LTE signal where you will be utilizing the hotspot/router to ensure the best possible speeds.

                            These are wireless mobile hotspots, and can be used &quot;on the move&quot;. We&#039;ve tested them on interstates in vehicles, and they work well. This being said, there are definitely times when heading into wooded areas or valleys/mountains, the signal will cut out. However, if you are on open roads with many cell towers around the carrier you are utilizing... then it&#039;s relatively steady. Think of our hotspots like your cell phone… you have coverage a lot of the time but not all of the time. We would recommend using it in one place overall, but traveling with these are quite nice. Just don&#039;t expect perfect constant signal.

                            Since our hotspots are engineered and made by humans, they won’t always function properly. The only way your service would be interrupted is if your signal is not strong enough, or you didn’t pay your bill. However, with anything, there may be extreme circumstances beyond our control like a cell tower getting struck by lightning that you&#039;re pinging off of for example. Or if your current hotspot stops working for no reason, we will be happy to troubleshoot with you to figure it out and get you back up and running!

                            For normal internet usage, YES! No more data caps! No more overages! All of our plans include unlimited high speed data for normal internet usage such as streaming music, movies, surfing, gaming and more! However, surfing/downloading illegal content as well as data abuse is prohibited. Data abusers are those who purposefully push limits or conduct known illegal activity like torrenting etc. If you consistently burn through over 500+GBs/mo, that is typically considered outside of normal internet usage and in some cases you could be asked to split your usage between two accounts. To put that into perspective the average Household in America uses less than 200 GBs/month. So just please utilize our devices with regular discretion so we can continue to provide our members with high speed wireless internet.
